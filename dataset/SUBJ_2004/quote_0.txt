it may not be " last tango in paris " but . . .	0
there's much tongue in cheek in the film and there's no doubt the filmmaker is having fun with it all .	0
care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up , but he never really embraces the joy of fuhrman's destructive escapism or the grace-in-rebellion found by his characters .	0
the limited sets and small confined and dark spaces also are homages to a classic low-budget film noir movie .	0
a moving and stark reminder that the casualties of war reach much further than we imagine .	0
a psychological thriller that doesn't really hold up if you think about it too much , but is nonetheless highly entertaining in a low-budget , david lynch-ian way .	0
part of the long , noble tradition ( at least since the '90s ) of talky , ensemble-driven american indies .	0
this odd , poetic road movie , spiked by jolts of pop music , pretty much takes place in morton's ever-watchful gaze -- and it's a tribute to the actress , and to her inventive director , that the journey is such a mesmerizing one .	0
as directed by dani kouyate of burkina faso , sia lacks visual flair . but kouyate elicits strong performances from his cast , and he delivers a powerful commentary on how governments lie , no matter who runs them .	0

what was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian .	0
this idea has lost its originality . . . and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture .	0
to show these characters in the act and give them no feelings of remorse -- and to cut repeatedly to the flashback of the original rape -- is overkill to the highest degree .	0
this is a terrific character study , a probe into the life of a complex man .	0

as an entertainment , the movie keeps you diverted and best of all , it lightens your wallet without leaving a sting .	0
most of the information has already appeared in one forum or another and , no matter how broomfield dresses it up , it tends to speculation , conspiracy theories or , at best , circumstantial evidence .	0
so muddled , repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker's characteristic style .	0

the film tunes into a grief that could lead a man across centuries .	0
turning a great movie into a pretty good one is still a step in the wrong direction . . . and the ring will never be more than a pretty good movie .	0

the sweetest thing is expressly for idiots who don't care what kind of sewage they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance .	0
i'm not sure which will take longer to heal : the welt on johnny knoxville's stomach from a riot-control projectile or my own tortured psyche .	0

viewing this underdramatized but overstated film is like watching a transcript of a therapy session brought to humdrum life by some freudian puppet .	0
as an actor's showcase , hart's war has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed willis is not the most impressive player . as a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by billy ray and terry george leaves something to be desired .	0
there's plenty to enjoy -- in no small part thanks to lau .	0
charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past love story derisions .	0
it's incredible the number of stories the holocaust has generated . just when you think that every possible angle has been exhausted by documentarians , another new film emerges with yet another remarkable yet shockingly little-known perspective .	0
for all its impressive craftsmanship , and despite an overbearing series of third-act crescendos , lily chou-chou never really builds up a head of emotional steam .	0

it just goes to show , an intelligent person isn't necessarily an admirable storyteller .	0
it's more enjoyable than i expected , though , and that's because the laughs come from fairly basic comedic constructs . cinematic pratfalls given a working over . the cast is spot on and the mood is laid back .	0
the character of zigzag is not sufficiently developed to support a film constructed around him .	0
the movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical . what's worse is that pelosi knows it .	0
